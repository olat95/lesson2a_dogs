            <img src="images/butterfly_dog.jpg" alt="dog image">
            <p>Dogs, <i>(Canis lupus familiaris)</i>, are domesticated mammals, 
                not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from 
                wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, 
                and probably were the first animals to be domesticated. .
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, some dogs are used as pets while others are used 
                to help humans do their work. Dogs are popular pets because 
                they are usually playful, friendly, and listen well to humans. 
                Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered as pets. 
                Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold 
                in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including police dogs, 
                army dogs, service dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, 
                herding dogs, or rescue dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dogs are sometimes called "canines," which comes from the Latin 
                word for dog - canis. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe 
                other canids, such as wolves. A baby dog is called a <strong>pup</strong> or <strong>puppy</strong>. 
                A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because 
                they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.

            <h1>Origin of Dogs</h1>
            <p>
                All dogs are descended from wolves, by domestication and artificial 
                selection. This is known because DNA genome analysis has been done 
                to discover this. Dogs have been bred by humans.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest known fossil of a domestic dog is said to be from 
                31,700 years ago in Belgium. Scientists believe that dogs have 
                lived with people for at least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study 
                was published that showed that the skull and teeth of a canid, 
                dated to 33,000 years ago, had characteristics closer to a dog 
                than to a wolf, and the authors determined that "this specimen 
                may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other signs of domestication are that sometimes, dogs were 
                buried together with humans. Evidence of this is a tomb in Bonn, 
                where a man of about 50 years of age, a woman of about 25 years 
                of age, the remains of a dog, and other artifacts were found. 
                Radiocarbon dating showed that the human bones were between 
                13,300 and 14,000 years old.

            <h1>Appearance and Behavior</h1>
            <p>Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs 
                often chase <b>cats</b>, and most dogs will <b>fetch</b> a ball or stick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in 
                <b>color</b>. Due to the structure of the eye, dogs can see better 
                in dim light than humans. They can also see further around before 
                moving their eyes than a human can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called <b>packs</b>. 
                Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank 
                will submit to other dogs with a higher rank. The highest-ranked 
                dog is called the <b>alpha male</b>. Each dog in a pack helps and 
                cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.

            <p>
                Different dog breeds (kinds) have different lifespans. 
                In general, smaller dogs live longer than larger dogs. 
                The size and the breed of the dog change the average lifespan of a dog. 
                Breeds such as the <a href="images.html" target="_blank">Dachshund</a> usually live for fifteen years, 
                while <a href="images.html" target="_blank">Chihuahuas</a> can reach age twenty. 
                <a href="images.html" target="_blank">The Great Dane</a>, on the other hand, 
                has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have
